>**Abstract**:
Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have significantly enhanced our capability to analyze and interpret weather and climate data, especially at fine spatio-temporal scales, helping unravel the chaotic and nonlinear patterns of Earth's systems. The emergence of Foundation Models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has catalyzed advances in Artificial General Intelligence, delivering outstanding outcomes across various tasks through fine-tuning. The success of LLMs presents a novel opportunity to rethink the task of weather and climate data understanding: **Is it possible to utilize or evolve Foundation Models for weather and climate data to enhance the accuracy of task completion?** This survey evaluates the potential of adapting Foundation Models to enhance weather and climate data analysis. We present a concise, up-to-date review of cutting-edge AI techniques tailored for this domain, concentrating on time series and textual information. We cover four key areas: data types, model architectures, application scopes, and task-specific datasets. Furthermore, we address prevailing challenges, provide insights, and outline future research directions, empowering practitioners to advance the field. The survey distills the latest innovations in data-driven models, underscoring foundational strength, progress, applications, resources, and research frontiers, thus offering a roadmap for transformative advancements in weather and climate data understanding.
